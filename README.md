# Netflix Front-end Clone
The following project encompasses what was requested by the professor in Activity 06: 'Creation of a Netflix Front-end Clone'.

## Getting Started
In order to configure your machine to execute the following scripts, some requirements will be needed. Therefore, here is an example of the steps to follow to get a local copy.

## About the Project
The objective of this project is to test my Front-End skills. To achieve this, I used a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBweoUiMsDg) from the Bonieky Lacerda channel for assistance, as well as the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started).

#### Technologies Used
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* React DOM: The package that serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React.
